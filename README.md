# WebCBIR

This repo reffer from this <a href="https://github.com/ledleledle/CBIR">Repository</a> and i just convert it to some web. I'm using <a href="https://demos.creative-tim.com/argon-dashboard-pro/">Argon Template</a> which its nice :) . Its just like google image search but i just showing 5 picture most relevant (hopefully most relevant with object). Like always... Its just a school project. The datasets focus on desert, sea and mountain, also i add some wrong random image for testing. Sadly the datasets still have duplicate :(

> - Don't ask me how to clone retard :)
> - This is development server if you want to host on production server, you find out your own way!
> - For Windows users, i highly recommended using [Python 3.7.0](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.0/python-3.7.0.exe) or [Python 3.6.0](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.6.0/python-3.6.0.exe)

My method is, you upload the image, opencv and numpy process your image, system will save image to the temporary folder, showing the result, and the <code>app.route('/')</code> i use for checking the temporary folder is there exist or not. I will keep update this project and keep find the best method for best result. Hope you enjoy

Sorry for my bad English :(
